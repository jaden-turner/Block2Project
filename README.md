Assignment for CS3090 on Choosing a Copyright License w/an Ethical Analysis

### MIT License
This license was chosen for a number of reasons. This repository will likely be used for general coding projects, that I don't seek to make anything off of and don't mind if people use it for their own projects. The MIT license lets others use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribue, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the code here, only under the condition that the copyright notice and permission notice is included in all copies or portions of the code used elsewhere. As this license is also largely popular on this platform, that provided another good reason to choose it for a repository such as this one.

## Ethical Analyisis
